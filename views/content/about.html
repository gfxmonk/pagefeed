<h2>Get your links delivered to your feed reader</h2>

<p>
	Pagefeed allows you to add any web page to your personalised feed of pages.
	It's similar to (and inspired by) <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">instapaper</a>, except it works with whatever feed reader you want to use.
</p>

<p>
	Just <a href="/">log in</a>, add your (private) RSS feed to your feed reader, and you're set.
</p>
	
<p>
	There are a few ways to add pages. Obviously, you can use the form on the main page.
	But you can also use the bookmarklet, which will let you add any page without visiting PageFeed.
	Thirdly, there is an option in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gris/">GRiS</a> (Google Reader iPhone Sync) to save links to PageFeed for viewing later.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to add PageFeed integration to your own programs, <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#105;&#109;&#051;&#100;&#046;&#106;&#117;&#110;&#107;+&#112;&#097;&#103;&#101;&#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">get in touch</a> and I'll see what I can do about some API documentation.
</p>

<p>
	PageFeed is still in early development, so things may be a little unstable for a while.
	But the core functionality should be stable enough for everyday use, if you're brave and don't mind some rough edges ;)
